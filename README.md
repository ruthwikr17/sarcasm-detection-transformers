**Sarcasm Detection with Transformer Models**  
This project explores sarcasm detection in text by fine-tuning various Transformer models. It includes scripts to train, evaluate, and compare the performance of BERT, RoBERTa, and GPT-2 using PyTorch and the Hugging Face Transformers library.<br><br>  

**Project Overview**  
The primary goal of this project is to build and evaluate robust classifiers for detecting sarcasm in textual data. The project provides a framework for:  
		• Fine-tuning individual models like BERT and RoBERTa on a sarcasm dataset.  
		• Evaluating the performance of trained models using standard classification metrics.  
		• Conducting a comparative analysis to determine which model architecture performs best on this specific task.  <br><br>


**Tech Stack & Key Components**  
**- Models**  
		• **BERT (bert-base-uncased)**: A powerful bidirectional transformer model.  
		• **RoBERTa (roberta-base)**: A robustly optimized version of BERT with improved training methodology.  
		• **GPT-2 (gpt2)**: A generative transformer model, also adaptable for classification tasks.  

**- Libraries & Frameworks**  
		• **PyTorch**: The core deep learning framework.  
		• **Hugging Face transformers**: For accessing pre-trained models and using the Trainer API.  
		• **Hugging Face datasets**: For handling and processing datasets efficiently.  
		• **Scikit-learn**: For performance metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score) and data splitting.  
		• **Pandas**: For data manipulation and loading CSV files.  
		• **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: For creating visualizations of model performance.  

**- Datasets**  
		• **Data/sarcasm_dataset.csv**: The primary dataset used for training the models.  
		• **Data/test_dataset 2.csv**: A test set used exclusively by metrics.py for model comparison.  
		• **Data/test_dataset 3.csv**: A test set used by the individual evaluation scripts (TestBert.py and TestRoberta.py).  <br><br>

**Getting Started**  
**- Requirements**  
		• Python 3  
		• Git  

**- Installation & Setup**  
		1 **Clone the repository**:  git clone https://github.com/ruthwikr17/Sarcasm-Detection-RoBERTa <br>
                               cd Sarcasm-Detection-RoBERTa    <br>
		2 **Create a virtual environment (recommended)**:  python -m venv venv  
          	                                     source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`  
		3 **Install the required packages**:  pip install torch transformers datasets pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn  <br><br>


**Workflow and Usage**  
This project provides two distinct workflows: one for building a specific, usable model, and another for conducting a comparative experiment.  

**- Individual Model Scripts** (Bert.py,  RoBERTa.py, etc.)  
	• Purpose: These scripts are for the end-to-end process of building a single, deployable model.  
	• Workflow: You run RoBERTa.py to train the model and save the final version. You then use TestRoberta.py to evaluate that specific saved model and use it for predictions. This simulates a production-like pipeline where you create a tool and then test it.  

**- Metrics Comparison Script** (metrics.py)  
	• Purpose: This script is an experimental testbed designed to answer the question: "Which model architecture is best for this specific task?"  
	• Workflow: It trains BERT, RoBERTa, and GPT-2 from scratch under the same conditions and directly compares their performance metrics. Its goal is not to save a final model for later use, but to generate a comparative analysis to inform which architecture you might choose to build with the individual scripts.  <br><br>


**Future Additions**  
Potential improvements and future directions for this project include:  
1. Hyperparameter Tuning: Integrating tools like Optuna or Ray Tune to find the optimal hyperparameters for training.  
2. Expanded Model Comparison: Including newer architectures like DeBERTa, ELECTRA, or XLNet in the metrics.py comparison script.  
3. Web Interface: Building a simple front-end with Streamlit or Gradio to make the sarcasm prediction tool more user-friendly.
